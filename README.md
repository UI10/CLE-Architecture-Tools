# CLE-Architecture-Tools

The File Templates can be use to create new Rx Scenes (use one of these instead of creating a View Controller directly.) Place the folder in `Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`.

The Utilities folder contains support code that should be included in the project. The most important file, from an architectural perspective, is "Presenter.swift". The others are helpful, but not necessary.
