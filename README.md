# CLE-Architecture-Tools

The File Templates can be use to create new Rx Scenes (use one of these instead of creating a View Controller directly.) Place the folder in `Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`.

The Utilities folder contains support code that should be included in the project. The most important files, from an architectural perspective, are "Stage.swift" and "Scene.swift". The others are helpful, but not necessary.
