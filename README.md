# CLE-Architecture-Tools

The File Templates can be use to create new Rx Scenes (use one of these instead of creating a View Controller directly.) Place the folder in `Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`.

The Utilities folder contains support code that should be included in the project. The most important files, from an architectural perspective, are "Stage.swift" and "Scene.swift". The others contain code that I used in 80% or more of my projects.

The Tools foder contains helpers that I have developed but aren't needed in most projects.
